We don't have a good _automated_ producer/consumer test.

For manual testing, that looks like this:

1. Start the two fowls:

    fowl --service iperf:54321 12345-foo-bar
    fowl --client iperf:12345 12345-foo-bar

2. run iperf3 server:

    iperf3 -4 -s localhost -p 54321

3. run the iperf3 client:

    iperf3 -4 -c localhost -p 12345 -n 3000M
    iperf3 -4 -c localhost -p 12345 -n 3000M --reverse

In both the normal and "reverse" case, we should NOT see the memory of
either client grow substantially (e.g. in failing cases it would crest
at about 3.0GB). In my tests, it's about 70M per client.

Note that both kinds of iperf3 client tests are required, as one tests
"NearToFar" and the other tests "FarToNear" (--reverse instructs the
_server_ iperf3 to send the data).
